# Game Master
The purpose of the Game Master application is to provide a character management system for gamers / dungeon masters for various table top games as well as provide some basic tools for gameplay such as dice rolls, coin flips and damage/healing calculators. The application allows users to create basic characters with customizable statistics and modifiers and import/export those character sets for future use.

## Why use Game Master?
The app attempts to make it easier to play certain games that require frequent calculations and probability roles without the need for a conventional calculator or physical dice. This makes it especially useful when used in an online environment. It will also make the process of creating and editing characters easy as well as allow for the tracking of changes made to those characters and store them in certain states between game sessions.
## Target Audience
The target audience of the application is primarily table top board or card gamers who would benefit most from the character management system and various calculators. Secondary target audiences would also include people seeking to create their own games or stories where a database of characters would also be a useful tool.
## How to use
The use of the application is simple, and consists of a hierarchical set of menus, each with options for the user to select. On start-up, the user will be shown a main menu which will give them access to the character manager menu, which itself will include options to create new characters, edit or delete existing ones as well import or export any previously created characters or character sets. The different calculators will also be displayed from the main menu and each sub-menu will feature a help section which will provide information about what the currently selected menu can do and how to use it, with examples of use and if necessary, links to a more comprehensive tutorial of use. Each menu will have an option to go back to the previous menu, back to the main menu and an exit option for ease of navigation.
